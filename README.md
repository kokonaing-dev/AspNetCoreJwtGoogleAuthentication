# AspNetCoreJwtGoogleAuthentication
A simple .NET Core MVC project demonstrating how to implement JWT authentication with Google OAuth and cookie-based authentication in ASP.NET Core.


## Features
- **Google OAuth Login**: Users can log in with their Google account.
- **Local Login**: Users can log in with email and password.
- **JWT Token Generation**: After login, a JWT token is issued for API calls.
- **Protected Pages**: Certain pages (e.g., Privacy) require authentication.
- **Access Control**: Users are redirected to the login page if they attempt to access protected pages without being authenticated.
